Hi everybody,

it has been a very long time without any new content. There have been a lot of changes in my life. I'll try to reboot the blog and the YouTube channel, but it will take some time. I try to be more consistent with new content. As this is a side project of mine, I will change the focus of the blog to be more in line with my daily work. This way I can hopefully produce content on a regular basis as it will more match with what I do anyway.

If you have seen the updated about page. I'm now working at VMware in the Modern Applications Business Unit, working on the Tanzu portfolio. So I'm covering the K8s topics and App transformation story. As this algins very good with this blog I'll use these technologies as the source for my blog. If I find some additional time I'll look into other technologies as well, but for the time being, I'll be focusing on this stack.

If you like to reach out, the best way is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devulrix).
