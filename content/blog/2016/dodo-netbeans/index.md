In our third Docker Donnerstag(DoDo) Video we cover the introduction of Docker for Netbeans. 
This video is based on our previous DoDo video in which we cover the basics of Docker for Windows. If you haven't watched it, have a look at it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cfkO70qttw) To use Docker for Netbeans you need to load the [nightly build](http://bits.netbeans.org/download/trunk/nightly/latest/).

If you would like to submit your own idea for an upcoming Docker Donnerstag, send me a message on twitter.

Have fun with the video.
