In our fifth Docker Donnerstag(DoDo) Video we cover the introduction of Docker for Respberry PI 3. We start with a fresh install of [Raspbian Jessi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). We install Docker and afterwards create our on Java Docker image for ARM.

For further information regarding the Docker support for ARM have a look at the [hypriot blog](http://blog.hypriot.com/).

If you would like to submit your own idea for an upcoming Docker Donnerstag, send me a message on twitter.

Have fun with the video.
