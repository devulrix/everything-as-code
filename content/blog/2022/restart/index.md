Hi everybody,

It has been a while since there was new content. A lot has changed in my life. Foremost, I’m married now with the love of my life and we have a son. We moved to a new home and all this happened during Covid times. A new job and acquisition happened.

I’ll try to reboot the blog and the YouTube channel, but it will take time. I try to be more consistent with new content. This is a side project of mine, I will change the focus of the blog to be more in line with my daily work. This way, I can hopefully produce content regularly.

If you have written nothing new in 6 years, it’s mandatory to not only rebuild the entire layout of the website but the pipelining as well. So I moved everything to GitHub Actions. The Website should be much more mobile friendly. I’m using WebP as image format.  

Not only did we change the layout of the website, but also the logo of Everything as Code. I used [ei8htz](https://www.fiverr.com/ei8htz/design-2-outstanding-logo) on [fiverr](https://fiverr.com) to create the new logo and the 404 page logo.

As stated above, I still plan to create YouTube videos. So I wanted to get an intro video for the channel as well. I used the services of [reaperworks](https://www.fiverr.com/reaperworks/create-a-minimal-youtube-intro-for-your-channel) for this. You can see the new intro in action in the video below.

If you have seen the updated about page. I’m now working at VMware in the Modern Applications Business Unit, working in the Tanzu portfolio. So I’m covering the K8s topics and App transformation story. As these algins are very good with this blog, I’ll use these technologies as the source for my blog. If I find some additional time, I’ll look into other technologies as well, but for the time being, I’ll be focusing on this stack.

If you like to reach out, the best way is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devulrix).
