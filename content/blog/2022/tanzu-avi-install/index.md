## Overview

In this multi-part series, we will instal Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service with vSphere 7 and vSphere Networking. With the update of vSphere 7U2, the support for NSX Advanced Load balancer (formaly known as AVI) was added. I'll be using the U3 update for vCenter.

If you're looking for an easy automated installation, have a look at William Lam's [repository](https://github.com/lamw/vsphere-with-tanzu-nsx-advanced-lb-automated-lab-deployment). William is building an automated nested environment to get you started in less than an hour.

## Prerequisites

Before we can start, we need to make sure that we meet the minimum criteria for the environment. 

* 3 ESXi hosts with vSphere 7.0 and Enterprise Plus license
* vCenter 7.0 U3
* 3 routed Networks
  * **Managment Network** with 5 consecutive IP addresses and minimum 6 in total
  * At least one **Workload Network** with the size of the K8s workers you want to support. In this tutorial we'll be using a /24.
  * One **VIP/Frontend Network** with the size of the Load Balancer Service you want to use. At least 1 for each K8s cluster is needed.

For a full list of requierements have a look at the official [documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-7FF30A74-DDDD-4231-AAAE-0A92828B93CD.html). We will be covering the network setup in much more detail in the [vSphere Networking](#vsphere-with-tanzu---vsphere-networking) section.

## Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Deployment

After the installation finished the next step is to create our first Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster.
