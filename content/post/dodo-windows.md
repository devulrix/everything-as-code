Today we announced our second Docker Donnerstag Video, or Docker Thursday. This will be our first episode in English. In this episode we will have a look a the new release of Docker for Windows and what you can do with it.

If you would like to submit your own idea for an upcoming Docker Donnerstag, send me a message on twitter.

Have fun with the video.
