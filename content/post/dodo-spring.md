In this weeks episode of Docker Donnerstag(DoDo) we have a look at the Spring Framework and how to integrate a Spring application into Docker with Netbeans. In our previous DoDo [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcxUF1q1HDw) we introduced the Docker integration in Netbeans. If you haven't watched it have a look at it first. As we use the information as the foundation for this weeks video.

If you would like to submit your own idea for an upcoming Docker Donnerstag, send me a message on twitter.

Have fun with the video.
