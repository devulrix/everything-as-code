# Everything as Code

This is the repository for the [everything-as-code.de](http://everything-as-code.de) Website.

The Blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open source, fast & modern static site generator. I like the fact that Hugo is written in Go and focuses on speed. There are a lot of interesting features and I only barely scratched the surface of its capabilities. I'm using the [HStartbootstrap Clean Blog theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/) by [Beno√Æt Benedetti](http://www.humboldtux.com/). The theme is based on the [Start Bootstrap Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/).
