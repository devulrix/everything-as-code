# Everything as Code

This is the repository for the [everything-as-code.de](http://everything-as-code.de) Website.

The Blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open source, fast & modern static site generator. I like the fact that Hugo is written in Go and focuses on speed. There are a lot of interesting features and I only barely scratched the surface of its capabilities.

The theme for this site was build by following the great [tutorial](https://pakstech.com/series/blog-with-hugo/) of [Janne Kemppainen](https://twitter.com/pakstech).
